# Investigate-Data-Set

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

I wrote codes to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Below is the code for this project.

              'new york city': 'new_york_city.csv',
              'washington': 'washington.csv' }
