# Investigate-Data-Set

For this project, I conducted data analysis and created a file that documented my findings. 

Firstly, I brainstormed on what questions I could answer using the dataset available. 

Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I listed out and created a report of the answers to these questions.
